# Skill: Chat-Format

Turn a flat exported chat file into a navigable document with numbered Q-sections and meaningful titles.

## Why

A raw export from Gemini/ChatGPT/Claude/DeepSeek is a linear stream of prompt/response markers. Twenty turns in, the sidebar TOC is just "Prompt, Response, Prompt, Response..." — useless. The user can't jump to "where did we discuss SAP migration?" without scrolling.

The fix is structural:

- Each prompt/response pair collapses into one H2: `## Q01 — Brief title`. The TOC reads like a real table of contents.
- The user's message and the assistant's reply are separated inside the section by a horizontal rule. Visually distinct turns, no decorative labels needed.
- Subheadings inside answers nest under the Q-heading. If a response uses `##` (or HTML `<h2>` in HTML-bodied sources), shift it down a level so it doesn't collide with the Q-marker. `<h3>` shifts to `####` in the same pass.

After this, `!рендер` gives a PDF with proper bookmarks and a clickable sidebar by topic.

## Quality Criteria

- **Titles are concrete and specific.** "Миграция Google с Oracle на SAP" — not "Вопрос про SAP" or "Корпоративный софт". A reader scanning the TOC should recognize each turn.
- **Titles match what the USER asked**, not what the assistant covered. The user navigates their own chat by how they remember the question, not by the answer's structure.
- **Length: 2-6 words.** Long enough to disambiguate, short enough to scan in a sidebar.
- **All pairs numbered, none skipped.** Even one-liner exchanges get their own Q-heading.
- **Body text untouched.** Only the headings change. Never rewrite, paraphrase, or re-flow prompt/response content.

## Pipeline

### 1. Detect the markers and the body format

Different sources use different markers. Inspect the file before writing the script:

```bash
grep -nE "^(## Prompt:|## Response:|### You:|### Assistant:|### User|### DeepSeek AI|\*\*You:\*\*|\*\*ChatGPT:\*\*)" file.md | head -20
```

Common patterns:

- Gemini export: `## Prompt:` / `## Response:`
- ChatGPT markdown export: often `### You:` / `### ChatGPT:` or bold variants
- Claude.ai export: varies — inspect first
- DeepSeek share-page export: `### User` / `### DeepSeek AI`

Also check what's *inside* the message bodies. The marker substitution logic stays the same across sources, but the body may not be plain markdown:

```bash
grep -oE "<[a-zA-Z][^>]*>" file.md | sort -u | head -20   # HTML tags?
grep -c "思考" file.md                                     # DeepSeek thinking blocks?
```

If the bodies are HTML, you need a source-specific cleanup pass before the marker substitution. Currently documented:

- **DeepSeek** (HTML bodies with `<p class="ds-markdown-paragraph">`, thinking blocks `<p>思考：</p><blockquote>...</blockquote>`, code-block chrome with Copy/Download buttons): see `chat-format/deepseek-cleanup.md`.

Other sources (ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini) currently export plain-ish markdown; if you encounter HTML in their bodies, write a sibling cleanup companion following the DeepSeek one as template.

**Two-pass principle: technical first, semantic last.** The pipeline below runs cleanup before naming because drafting titles by reading messy HTML is wasteful — every `<p class="ds-markdown-paragraph">` and `<span class="">` you scan to extract the user's actual question is attention spent on chrome instead of substance. Convert to clean Markdown first, then read the clean file to draft titles, then apply Q-numbering.

### 2. Back up and run the technical cleanup pass

Always copy the file to `<file>.bak` before writing anything. Regex-based cleanup — especially the source-specific HTML passes — can miss an edge case on an unfamiliar export shape. With a backup, you restore and adjust; without one, you re-export from the source (if the source even still has the chat available).

```bash
cp "file.md" "file.md.bak"
```

If step 1 detected HTML in the bodies, run the source-specific cleanup pass now. It rewrites each body to clean Markdown, leaves the role markers (`### User` / `### DeepSeek AI` / etc.) in place, and strips decorative inter-message `---` separators. For DeepSeek, follow `chat-format/deepseek-cleanup.md` — its script writes the cleaned file back to the same path.

If the bodies are already plain Markdown (Gemini-style export), skip the cleanup and proceed.

### 3. Read every pair, draft titles

Now the file is clean Markdown. Read it in full. For each prompt/response pair, write down a 2-6 word title capturing what the user asked. Verify the title against the question: would the user, scanning their own TOC, recognize this turn? If the title could fit any of three different turns, it's too generic — sharpen it.

This step is semantic and goes last among the read-and-think phases for a reason: doing it after cleanup means you read substance, not HTML.

### 4. Run the Q-numbering substitution

Python's `re.sub` with a callback handles per-occurrence numbering cleanly. Sed/awk struggle with Unicode titles + counters.

```python
import re

PATH = "<absolute path to chat file>"
TITLES = [
    "Title for Q01",
    "Title for Q02",
    # ... one entry per prompt/response pair, in order
]

# Adjust these two literals to the markers your source uses
PROMPT_MARKER = "## Prompt:\n"
RESPONSE_MARKER = "## Response:\n"

with open(PATH, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    content = f.read()

n_prompt = content.count(PROMPT_MARKER)
n_response = content.count(RESPONSE_MARKER)
assert n_prompt == len(TITLES), f"Found {n_prompt} prompts, expected {len(TITLES)}"
assert n_response == len(TITLES), f"Found {n_response} responses, expected {len(TITLES)}"

counter = {"i": 0}
def replace_prompt(_m):
    i = counter["i"]
    counter["i"] += 1
    return f"## Q{i+1:02d} — {TITLES[i]}\n\n"

content = re.sub(re.escape(PROMPT_MARKER), replace_prompt, content)
content = content.replace(RESPONSE_MARKER, "---\n\n")

with open(PATH, "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    f.write(content)

print(f"Done. Replaced {len(TITLES)} prompt/response pairs.")
```

The assertion is load-bearing: if marker counts and title count disagree, the file has a malformed pair (orphan marker, stray content). Fix the file or the title list before running.

### 5. Verify

```bash
grep -nE "^## " file.md             # Q-headings sequential?
grep -cE "<[a-zA-Z/]" file.md       # 0 if no orphan HTML left
```

Visual sanity check that H2 headings are now `Q01 — ...`, `Q02 — ...`, sequential, with sensible titles. Past 99 pairs, switch to `Q001`-style padding.

If `<[a-zA-Z` shows orphan HTML on an HTML-bodied source, the source-specific cleanup pass missed something — restore from `.bak`, fix the cleanup, re-run.

## Format conventions

- `## Q01 — Title` — em dash (`—`, U+2014), zero-padded to two digits.
- Horizontal rule is `---` on its own line, with blank lines above and below. Two blank lines around it prevents accidental setext-heading interpretation in CommonMark.
- Subheadings inside answers must stay deeper than the `## Q##` markers. `###` / `####` are kept as-is; `##` (or HTML `<h2>`) is shifted to `###` and `<h3>` to `####` in the same pass. Never promote a subheading up to `##` — that shadows the Q-numbering and breaks the TOC.

## Anti-patterns

| Don't | Why |
|-------|-----|
| Generate titles without reading the body | "Вопрос N", "Уточнение", "Продолжение" defeat the entire point — the TOC is the deliverable |
| Title from the answer instead of the question | The user navigates by what they asked. "Three levels of languages" feels disconnected when the actual prompt was "Правильно ли я понимаю что у нас выходит три уровня языков?" |
| Use sed/awk for the substitution | Per-occurrence counter with Unicode titles → Python `re.sub(callback)` is the clean path |
| Skip the horizontal rule between prompt and response | Without the visual break, where the user message ends and the assistant reply begins becomes a guess |
| Write `## Q01:` or `## Q01.` instead of `## Q01 — ` | Em dash reads naturally in both Russian and English; consistency across docs |
| Edit prompt or response text | Out of scope. Restructuring markers is not an editorial pass. If the user wants the chat condensed, that's a different task |
| Drop the assertion in the script | Silently produces partial output if title list and marker count disagree. Assertion fails fast and points at which side is wrong |
| Render to PDF inside this skill | Out of scope — `!рендер` is a separate, composable step. Don't bundle |
| Run cleanup without a `.bak` backup | HTML-bodied sources can throw edge cases at any regex; restoring is cheap, re-exporting may be impossible |
| Treat HTML body as plain markdown and substitute markers naively | Leaves a mess of `<div>`, `<span>`, thinking blocks in the output. Detect HTML in step 1; route to the source-specific companion |
| Leave `<h2>` in response bodies untouched | Collides with `## Q##` headings and breaks the TOC. Always shift HTML-body headings down a level |
