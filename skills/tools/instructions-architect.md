# Skill: Instructions Architect

Design AI agent instructions that work and do what's expected.

## Core Philosophy

**The only goal is a working agent.** Token cost is NEVER a criterion. Shorter is easier to parse, focused is more stable — but if longer text works better, use longer. If verbose explanation helps — be verbose.

## The Reader

Every file in this workspace is read by a future agent at runtime. No human opens instruction files to review content — humans correct course through the agent when they see drift. If a sentence doesn't change what the agent does on a turn, it has no reader.

Cut from files:

- **Design rationale** («why this mechanism over another») — agents don't need convincing to apply a rule; they need the rule and its boundaries.
- **Defence of choices for future maintainers** — no future human maintainers exist.
- **Documentation framing** («this file describes…», «the purpose of this section is…») — agents orient by content, not by meta.
- **Leading WHY** (see «Explain the Why») — keep only when removing it changes the agent's interpretation of the rule.

The filter is strictest for always-loaded files (core_instructions.md, output styles). On-demand skills and personas can carry slightly more scaffolding since they load only when their task is active. Default posture: write for the agent executing at runtime.

## Edit Protocol

IA works in the instructions workspace (path from `instructionsPath` in `workspace_info`).

- **All edits** — IA edits in place. There is no human-review checkpoint on file content.
- **Paradigm shifts** — IA still edits in place, but flags the shift in chat so the user knows to watch for behavioral changes.
- **Commits** — user commits. IA doesn't commit, doesn't push, doesn't merge to main.

## How to Write Instructions

### Explain the Why

Two kinds of WHY — only one belongs in the file.

- **Behavioral WHY** shapes how the agent interprets and applies the rule at execution time. «Retrospective questions are reasoning requests, not rollback orders» changes how the agent reads user messages. Keep it.
- **Design-defence WHY** argues for the chosen rule against alternatives. «We chose prediction over checklists because checklists are skimmable» defends a past decision to a reviewer who doesn't exist. Cut it.

Test: remove the WHY. If the agent's execution becomes less certain, keep it. If removal only loses the ability to defend the choice in review, remove it.

LLMs have good theory of mind and respond to behavioral motivation better than to rote rules. **Every rule should carry its behavioral reason.**

If you find yourself writing ALWAYS or NEVER in all caps, or stacking rigid MUSTs — that's a yellow flag. Reframe: explain the behavioral reasoning so the agent understands why this matters at execution. That produces more robust behavior than shouting.

Bad: `NEVER use markdown links for paths`
Good: `Use backticks for paths (`` `skills/modes/planning.md` ``), not md-links — md-links break when instructions are loaded from varying nesting depths`

**Leading WHY pattern:** The strongest instructions open with the reason, and the rule follows naturally. The reader understands the motivation before encountering the constraint — which makes the constraint feel obvious rather than imposed.

Bad: `Keep plan.md to one screen. The user reads it to understand the full picture.`
Good: `The user reads plan.md to understand the full picture without opening other files. Keep it to one screen.`

This pattern comes from `core_instructions.md` L7+ rules — study how each rule's first sentence is a WHY that makes the action self-evident.

### Progressive Disclosure

Skills use a three-level loading system. Write with this in mind:

1. **YAML frontmatter** (name, description, trigger/noTrigger) — always in context via workspace_info catalog. The description and trigger fields determine whether the agent loads the skill. Make them specific about WHEN to use, not just WHAT it does.
2. **Skill file body** (<500 lines ideal) — loaded when skill activates. Everything the agent needs to start working.
3. **Companion resources** (unlimited) — loaded on demand. Reference files, prompts, templates. Point to them from skill file with clear guidance on WHEN to read.

If approaching 500 lines, add hierarchy: split into a main file with pointers to reference files.

### Keep It Lean

After writing, reread with fresh eyes and cut anything that isn't pulling its weight. Signs of bloat:
- Context the agent already has from its system prompt (L7+ rules, project management, spec-driven development, glossary — all always present). Don't restate rules like `[tradeoff]`, `[verify]`, `[honest]`, project folder conventions, or plan.md structure
- Knowledge the agent has built-in (don't teach it Python — teach it YOUR conventions)
- Descriptions of behavior instead of prescriptions ("X is important" → "When X, do Y")
- Rules that exist "just in case" with no concrete scenario

### Generalize, Don't Overfit

Instructions get used across many sessions with different contexts. If you're fixing a specific failure, ask: is this a pattern or a one-off? The fix should address the pattern, not the single case. Overly specific patches accumulate into brittle instruction sets.

### Examples > Explanations

An example of good output teaches more than a paragraph describing what good output looks like. When a rule is hard to articulate precisely, show 2-3 examples instead.

## Writing Skills

Schema: `schemas/skill_file.md`. Read it before writing.

**What makes a good skill file:**

- **Starts with the job.** First line after title = what the agent should be able to DO after reading this.
- **One read = ready to work.** If the agent needs to read 3 more files before it can start — the skill is too fragmented.
- **Specific to your context.** YOUR conventions, YOUR project's patterns, YOUR preferred approach.

**Complex skills** use a companion folder for resources and a scripts directory for code:

```
skills/tools/scriptor.md          ← skill file (loaded by agent)
skills/tools/scriptor/            ← resources: prompts, templates
scripts/scriptor/                 ← Python code
```

Markdown and Python don't mix — skills in `skills/`, scripts in `scripts/`.

## Writing Personas

A persona defines WHO the agent is for the session.

Good personas have:
- **Clear focus area** — what domains this persona is best at
- **Behavioral traits** — how it thinks, responds, pushes back
- **Boundaries** — what this persona does NOT do (defers to other personas)

Bad personas are just skill lists with a name on top. If removing the name changes nothing — it's not a persona.

## Maintaining the Catalog

The catalog is built dynamically from YAML frontmatter in each file. Every persona and skill must have valid frontmatter (name, description). `index.json` declares which folders to scan.

When IA adds a new file, it ensures the file has proper YAML frontmatter. If adding to a new category folder, it also updates `index.json`. This is one atomic action.

## Checklist

Before editing an existing file:
- [ ] Read the current version first
- [ ] Is there a schema for this file type? (`schemas/`)
- [ ] What concrete problem am I fixing? (no edits "for cleanliness")

When adding a new skill:
- [ ] Skill file in `skills/<category>/` following `schemas/skill_file.md`
- [ ] YAML frontmatter with name, description (and shortcuts/trigger if applicable)
- [ ] If complex — companion folder for resources, scripts in `scripts/`

## Anti-patterns

| Don't | Why not | Do instead |
|-------|---------|------------|
| Stack ALWAYS/NEVER/MUST rules | Rigid rules break on edge cases; agents respond better to reasoning | Explain the why, let agent generalize |
| Repeat bootstrapper or index.md content | Bloat; agent already has it in context | Focus on what only THIS file teaches |
| Teach built-in knowledge | Waste of tokens and attention | Focus on YOUR specific conventions |
| Include design-choice defence in always-loaded files («we chose X because Y is worse») | No agent needs convincing at execution time; no human reviews the design. Pure attention cost on every turn | Strip to operational content. Rationale, if preserved at all, goes in commit message or design note outside loaded context — never in the file |
| Write narrow patches for one-off failures | Accumulates into brittle instructions | Fix the pattern, not the instance |
| Describe behavior ("X is important") | Agent needs to know what to DO | Prescribe: "When X, do Y" |
| Deeply nested references (>2 levels) | Agent loses track, costs tokens | Flat: one hop from main file |
| Put Python next to markdown | Confuses skill content with code | `skills/` for md, `scripts/` for py |
| Use md-links for instruction paths | Break at varying nesting depths | Backticks: `` `skills/tools/checkpoint.md` `` |
| Forget YAML frontmatter on new files | Catalog won't pick them up | Always add name + description frontmatter |
